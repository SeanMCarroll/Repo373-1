# QUIZ - Week 03

1. See below most of a function definition for `do_it`( ),  the complete definition for `fnc()`, and the start of main():

   ```c
   int do_it(int (*fp)(int n, int k), int n, int m)
   {
       int arg1 = n;
       int arg2 = m;
       int result =  ____________________________________________________;
       return result;
   }    
   
   int fnc(int a, int b)
   {
       return a/2 + b/3;
   }
   
   int main(){
       int x = do_it(______________________________, 1000, 321);
       ...
           
   ```

   1. Please fill in line 15 so that *main* calls *do_it()* to calculate the *fnc()* of 1000 and 321.

   2. Please fill in the code for line 5 so that *do_it()* will calculate **result** using the object of pointer *fp* as applied to the parameters *arg1* and *arg2*.<br>

      

2. Write an example of casting a pointer from void-pointer  (say variable _pv_) ==> int16_t-pointer (say variable _pi_).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

3. Examine the C declaration `void fnc(const int *a, int const *b, int* const c, int *d)`. 

   1. Which of the four parameters can be incremented (as in x++)? <br><br><br><br><br>
   2. All the parameters are pointer types. Which of the four parameters can be written-to, as in (*x) = 3; ?<br><br><br><br><br>

4. The key characteristics of a queue ...
   1. Can you extract all the data from a queue AT ONCE, or must you access the data message-by-message, one-at-a-time?
   1. If you do access just one message of many stored, how does the queue decide WHICH of the messages will be delivered to you? (Is each message marked with a  timestamp, or a priority? Must you ask for a specific message, as you access an array by index? Or is there some other method?)<div style="page-break-after: always; break-after: page;"></div>

5. When are queues used? (choose the best)

   1. In all embedded systems.
   2. Whenever asynchronous functions interact.
   3. Mostly for interrupts.
   4. Mostly for serial communication peripherals.<br><br>

6. Clock trees: Does the clock tree ... (choose the best answer)

   1. ... usually distribute the clock signal to subsystems of the ARM;
   2. ... usually slow down the clock;
   3. ... usually both.<br><br>

7.  What is the "HAL"? (choose the best answer)
    1. A library of functions to control peripherals.
    2. A peripheral on the STM32G071 that configures/controls the other peripherals.
    3. A program that offers a graphical user interface to configure peripherals and then generates a ".ioc" file.
    4. A software license quoted in the automatic README file for an STM32CubeIDE project .
